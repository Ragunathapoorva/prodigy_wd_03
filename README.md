Project Overview:
The Tic-Tac-Toe web application is a simple and interactive game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to create a responsive grid layout where two players can take turns marking their symbols (X or O) in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

Why We Use These Technologies:
HTML: Provides the structure of the web application. It's essential for creating the layout and elements of the game board.

CSS: Adds style and design to the application. It ensures the game is visually appealing and user-friendly.

JavaScript: Brings the game to life by adding interactivity. It handles user input, manages game state, and checks for winning conditions.
